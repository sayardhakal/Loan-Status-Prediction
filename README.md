# Loan-Status-Prediction
In this project, I am building a Loan Status Prediction using Python machine learning. I have used Support Vector Machine model for training my data. The dataset used in this project was from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication). The dataset contain 13 column one with label column named "Loan Status" . I haved used all the column expect "Loan_ID" for predicting the model. Overall process done in this project are listed below:
1. Data Collection and Pre-processing
2. Data Visualization
3. Train Test Split
4. Training the model
5. Evaluating the model
6. Building a Predictive model.
